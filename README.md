This folder contains all code for data preparation, training, and validation process for Group2 546 Final Project GANNET-seg.


* `./code`: contains all training code and validation code.

* `./notebook`: contains all experiment we've down in our project.

* `./data`: contains `.csv` file that includes information of your training subjects and test subjects.

* `./GAN`: contains pretrained GAN model for generating normal brain tissue in masked region.

* `./result`: saved our trained model (not trained yet)

* `./requirements.txt`: includes all reliance you need to install when running our code.

Paper has attached and you may also find useful information from the poster.


Greetings from Qifei[qifei@seas] and Xinyu[xinyulu@seas], feel free to reach us if you met any problems running code.
